"""vesmaro-eyes task board — persistent SQLite layer.

The board is deliberately a thin projection over two sources of truth:

1. Its own SQLite store (on a mounted volume) holding board tasks.
2. The live mnemos memory engine, which the server reaches over HTTP
   (in-cluster service DNS in the ai-agent cluster, loopback in dev).

Task state mirrors the mnemos workflow state machine
(``open → in-progress → blocked / resolved / done / withdrawn``) so a task
and a memory speak the same lifecycle language.

        ``drop_missing``: when True, registry rows of this executor that
        the payload did NOT mention are deleted (a full listing — the
        zcode store is the authority). When False (partial/delta pushes),
        unmentioned rows keep their last scan state. Returns counts for
        the honest ingest response ({"upserted": n, "dropped": m}).

        Idempotency: a replayed payload is a no-op write of identical
        values (last_scan_at moves — an honest freshness tick, not a
        semantic change); the audit event is emitted only on the first
        sight of a (executor_id, native_id) pair (session.listed signal).

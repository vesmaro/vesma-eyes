# Host-side launcher for vesmaro-assignment-poller-user.service — starts
# the poller inside the distrobox and pins the two things distrobox-exec
# gets wrong for this layout (live-verified 2026-09-21):
#
# 1. the exec env leaks the HOST $HOME — start-poller.sh's $HOME-relative
#    paths would resolve to the wrong tree, so every path is absolute and
#    HOME is re-exported to the container home before anything runs;
# 2. `python3` in the exec PATH resolves to the host ~/.local/bin shim
#    (the mounted host home sits in PATH), which re-execs the interpreter
#    with a SCRUBBED environment — the board token never reached the
#    poller. The absolute container interpreter keeps the env.
#
# Install (HOST side): cp poller-unit-launcher.sh ~/.local/bin/ && chmod 700
# Adjust the two absolute prefixes below if the container/home layout
# differs (CONTAINER_BOX_HOME = the container's $HOME as seen from both
# sides; DISTROBOX_NAME = `distrobox list` name).

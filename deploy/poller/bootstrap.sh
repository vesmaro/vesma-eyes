# The OUTER -k is honest and bounded: the installer TEXT is public and
# secret-free, and the lab TLS is self-signed — the shell does not trust
# it yet (that is the chicken-and-egg this script exists to break). The
# content rides TLS to the board it names; EVERYTHING the script does
# afterwards (artifacts, registration, the poller itself) uses the
# PINNED lab CA fetched through it, with the sha256 fingerprint printed
# for the out-of-band owner check. Paranoid two-step (fetch, READ, then
# bash) — see REMOTE-EXECUTOR.md, Путь 1.
#
# What it does, in order: parse/sanity args → preflight (python ≥ 3.10,
# systemd, curl, openssl) → fetch the lab CA (ONE -k retry for the CA ONLY)
# → TRUST ANCHOR (AGW-9, АРХКОМ-8 В1): the CA fingerprint is verified
# against --expect-fp / VESMARO_EXPECT_FP silently (mismatch = abort,
# downloaded CA discarded), or printed for an out-of-band owner check with
# a STRICT /dev/tty prompt (stdin is the curl pipe); no anchor and no tty
# = abort. A pre-placed /etc/vesmaro/lab-ca.crt short-circuits the -k
# path (placement IS the out-of-band act) but still must match --expect-fp
# when one is given → venv + deps → artifacts over PINNED TLS → register
# with the enrollment token → write 0600 env + yaml (allowlist is an
# honest fail-closed SEED — edit it) → systemd system unit → verdict.
#
# Honesty rules (ADR 0009 §9, A3):
# - outbound-only: the script never opens ports, the board never pings in;
# - the enrollment token travels as a CLI ARGUMENT, never in a URL
#   (ADR 0012 §9); it is single-use, TTL 15 min — shell-history exposure
#   is bounded by design;
# - the generated allowlist CANNOT launch anything until the owner edits
#   the command: nomination ≠ execution (the board gate is the dictionary,
#   the launch gate stays the local allowlist).
# - re-run with a SPENT token and an existing install = UPDATE path:
#   re-download artifacts, PRESERVE the user's allowlist and executor_id,
#   restart — the upgrade story. Registration is never re-run (a used
#   token cannot mint a second executor; rotation = revoke + delete on the
#   board, then a fresh run with a new token and the same --name).
#
# Exit codes: 0 registered/updated · 2 bad arguments · 3 environment
# failed (preflight/TLS) · 4 registration refused (4xx, no idempotent
# path) · 5 install/systemd failure.

  --name     executor name (default: this hostname)
  --harness  harness id from the board's harness dictionary (default: zcode)
  --host     declared host string (default: this hostname)
  --expect-fp  TRUST ANCHOR (AGW-9): the expected lab-CA fingerprint in the
             board canon (SHA256:base64, what the enrollment screen shows
             as ca_fingerprint; a bare hex64 or sha256:-prefixed form is
             accepted too). Given → the fetched/pre-placed CA is verified
             SILENTLY; mismatch = abort, downloaded CA discarded.
             Env synonym: VESMARO_EXPECT_FP. Without an anchor the script
             prints the fingerprint and asks you to type the owner-confirmed
             value on /dev/tty (no tty + no anchor = abort).

Re-run behaviour: with an already-spent token and an existing install the
script takes the UPDATE path (fresh artifacts, your allowlist preserved).
Exit codes: 0 ok · 2 args · 3 environment · 4 registration refused ·
5 install/systemd.

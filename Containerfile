# vesma-eyes — task board container
#
# Multi-stage (ADR 0011 Ф0a): the React viewer is built from viewer/ in a
# Node stage and its dist/ ships inside the board image at /app/app
# (VESMARO_APP_DIR) — one Deployment/Ingress/NetPol serves both the board
# at / and the viewer at /app. Codegen for the viewer runs off the
# committed viewer/openapi-snapshot.json (offline: no vesma access, no
# network API calls at build time). npm ci needs the registry; that is the
# only network dependency of the build.
#
# Runtime: Python 3.12 slim, data (SQLite) on a mounted volume at /data.

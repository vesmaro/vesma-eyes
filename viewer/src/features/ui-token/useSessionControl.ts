/**
 * "What is this app instance's live contract right now?" — the four-state
 * derivation session-aware surfaces share (fix/login-feedback, UI-22, scope
 * v1 ADR 0012 Amendment). The sidebar footer and the overview badge state
 * all of them; surfaces on the boolean {@link useSessionControl} cut
 * collapse everything but "active" — only an owner session unlocks the
 * store-ops surfaces (automation settings, enrollment, devices).
 *
 * Truth table per adapter (capability, not configuration):
 * - "active": board/mock with a ui token present — taken from the gate's
 *   REACTIVE mirror so a login/logout flips every surface without a reload.
 * - "deviceControl": board WITHOUT a ui token, with a paired device whose
 *   scope is `control` (scope v1) — «устройство подключено · полный
 *   доступ»: the device mutates the board (tasks/reports/inbox/
 *   notifications); pairing/devices/auth/automation/agent-loop stay
 *   server-closed and stay UI-hidden (they key on the boolean cut).
 * - "device": same, but the device scope is `read` (the v0 shape —
 *   explicit least-privilege pairings) — «устройство подключено»,
 *   read-only by device scope, not by absence of identity.
 * - "readOnly": everyone else — the vesma HttpAdapter (not a
 *   TaskMutationSource → honest for L1 even behind an mnk_ session), the board
 *   with neither token, fail-soft fallbacks.
 *
 * Fail-soft outside a UiTokenProvider (SSR harnesses mount the chrome bare):
 * falls back to the adapter's own plain read — the same answer the gate
 * would be constructed with. The device flag has no reactive mirror (it is
 * written once by the /pair exchange, read on mount) — one honest read per
 * mount, storage-less environments answer "no identity" and never throw.
